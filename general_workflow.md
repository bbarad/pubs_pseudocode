# Getting from start to finish for 1-pot EMPIRIC data analysis.
## Computational Project Summary (for part 1)
For the 2014 pubs class, the students will be tasked with identifying the 
changing levels of different mutants of Ubiquitin in a complex population. To 
this end, they will take timepoints along a growth curve and sequence those
timepoints to get the number of each barcode at each timepoint. The barcodes
have previously been associated with a single point mutation by Iggy. The task
for the students will be to associate their barcodes with changes over time in
codon and ultimately amino acid space.

## Converting codon space to amino acid space. 
The day one project for the students will be to convert the barcode coverage 
heatmap from codon to amino acid space.
